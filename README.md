# What-is-Natural-Cycle-IVF-and-how-does-it-differ-from-standard-IVF-treatments-

Natural Cycle IVF is a fertility treatment that follows a woman’s natural menstrual cycle without using heavy fertility drugs. Unlike conventional IVF, where the ovaries are stimulated to produce multiple eggs, Natural Cycle IVF monitors the natural development of one egg and retrieves it when it's mature. This egg is then fertilized in the lab and, if successful, the embryo is transferred into the uterus.

This approach is suitable for women who don’t respond well to hormone medications or those who prefer a less invasive and more natural method. It’s also a good option for women with low ovarian reserve or medical conditions that prevent them from using fertility drugs. Though the success rate per cycle may be slightly lower than stimulated IVF, it can be repeated multiple times with fewer risks and costs.

Ayuh Fertility Centre specializes in various types of IVF, including Natural Cycle IVF. The clinic’s expert team ensures close monitoring and personalized care for every patient, making this gentle IVF approach a hopeful choice for many women. It also reduces the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and avoids the side effects of hormonal injections.
